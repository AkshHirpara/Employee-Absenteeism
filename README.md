# Employee-Absenteeism

The purpose was to build a model to derive insights on what issues are faced by employees of courier company and forecast the workloss for nect year.

Machine Learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest & Linear Regression are used. I have also used Ludwig algorithm launched by Uber which is one-shot place for building any model.


New Concepts Used:

Ludwig Algorithm:

•	The algorithm is launched by UBER- Artificial Intelligence team. They are using this algorithm since past many years but just before few months they made this algorithm public in GitHub.
•	I tried to apply on our data set and was successfully able to do that after several failed efforts.
•	The Error Metrics I got was very high RMSE was around 2.34 in numbers which is not at all acceptable.

•	Description:
o	Ludwig is a TensorFlow based toolbox that allows to train and test deep learning models without the need to write code. 

•	Properties:
o	Requires Minimal Coding.
o	WE can perform Sentiment Analysis, Natural Language Processing, Classification, Regression and what not!
o	We can also perform Deep Learning models.
o	Currently visualizations are not available for Jupyter Environment.
o	This algorithm is going to make disruptive change in coming time.

Data Explorer Library:
This library helps to create basic analysis report with interactive charts. This library generates a report which contains Missing Value calculation, Data Distribution, Data Analysing report.
